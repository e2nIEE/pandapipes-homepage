pandapipes is an easy to use network calculation program aimed at automation of analysis of district heating
and gas systems. It utilizes the data analysis library pandas and is also closely related to
the power systems calculation program pandapower.

pandapipes and pandapower can be used in combination to analyze multi energy networks. An environment able to couple both
tools is pandapowerpro.

## Why another tool?

**Motivation**<br>

pandapower was developed to close the gap between commercial and open source power systems analysis tools.
While open source power systems tools are flexible and can easily be customized, they often lack the detailed model libraries and
comfortable usage of commercial power system analysis tools.

This is of course a very broad classification of tools that is only supposed to illustrate the focus of pandapower without
considering the diverse landscape of existing tools. A more detailed analysis of existing open source tools and 
the gap that pandapower closes can be found in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2829021" title="L. Thurner, A. Scheidler, F.

.

**Scope**<br>

pandapower is aimed at **static** analysis of **balanced** power systems. This allows analysis of:
- **transmission** and **subtransmission systems**, which are typically operated symmetrically.
- **symmetric distribution systems**, which are commonly found in Europe.

Distribution grids with unbalanced power flows, such as the feeder design common in North America, can currently not be
analysed with pandapower.


<h2 id="modeling">Power System Modeling</h2>

<h3 id="circuits">Equivalent Circuit Models</h3>
pandapower is an element based network calculation tool that supports a wide variety of electric components. 
The following table shows that the pandapower model library goes beyond of that of most existing open source tools:

<img src="{{"/images/about/open_source_models.png" | relative_url }}" alt=""/>
<figcaption>Comparison of open source electric model libraries <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2829021" title="L. Thurner, A. Scheidler, F. Schäfer et al, pandapower - an Open Source Python Tool for Convenient Modeling, Analysis and Optimization of Electric Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 2018.">[1]</a></figcaption>

All equivalent circuit models are [thoroughly validated](#tests) against commercial software tools and therefore allow industry level modeling of electric power systems.

<h3 id="datastructure">Tabular Data Structure</h3>

pandapower is based on a tabular data structure, where every element type is represented by a table that holds all parameters for a specific
element and a result table which contains the element specific results of the different analysis methods. The tabular data structure is
based on the Python library pandas. It allows storing variables of any data type, so that electrical parameters can be stored
together with status variables and meta-data, such as names or descriptions. The tables can be easily expanded and customized by adding new
columns without influencing the pandapower functionality. All inherent pandas methods can be used to efficiently read, write and
analyze the network and results data.

<h3 id="std_types">Standard Type Libraries</h3>

pandapower includes a standard type library that allows the creation of lines and transformers using predefined basic standard type parameters. The user can either define individual standard types or use the predefined pandapower basic standard types for convenient definition of networks.

   
<h2 id="analysis">Power System Analysis</h2>

pandapower supports the following power systems analysis functions:

- [Power Flow](#pf)
- [Optimal Power Flow](#opf)
- [State Estimation](#se)
- [Short-Circuit Calculation](#sc)
- [Topological Graph Searches](#topology)

<h3 id="pf">Power Flow</h3>

The pandapower power flow solver is based on the Newton-Raphson method.
The implementation was originally based on PYPOWER, but has been improved with respect to
robustness, runtime and usability.
<br><small>[Learn more](http://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/stable/powerflow/ac.html)</small>

<font size="4"><b>Initialization</b></font>

pandapower offers three different methods to initialize the complex voltage
vector for the AC power flow calculation:
   - flat start
   - voltage vector of a previous calculation
   - initialization with a DC power flow
   
<font size="4"><b>Performance</b></font>

Some parts of the pandapower solver have been accelerated using the
JIT compiler [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/). This makes the pandapower Newton-Raphson significantly faster
than the PYPOWER solver from which it was originally derived.
To outline the difference in computational time, the convergence times for different standard MATPOWER
case files are shown here for MATPOWER, PYPOWER and pandapower:

<img src="{{"/images/about/speed_comparison.png" | relative_url }}" alt=""/>
<figcaption>Power flow speed convergence time comparison of different open source tools <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2829021" title="L. Thurner, A. Scheidler, F. Schäfer et al, pandapower - an Open Source Python Tool for Convenient Modeling, Analysis and Optimization of Electric Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 2018.">[1]</a></figcaption>

While PYPOWER and MATPOWER operate directly on the bus-branch model of the grid, the element based power system model in pandapower
requires mappings and conversions of grid data and results into the tabular data structure. The graph shows that this
conversion can take a significant amount of time in smaller networks, but its share decreases in larger networks. Even with 
the conversion overhead, pandapower is the fastest of the three tools in large grids with >1000 nodes.

<font size="4"><b>Other solvers</b></font>

In addition to the default Newton-Raphson solver, pandapower also
provides an implementation of a backward/forward sweep. pandapower also includes an Iwamoto variant of the Newton-Raphson,
which includes a damping factor that can help convergence in ill-conditioned problems. It is also possible to use the fast
decoupled as well as the Gauss-Seidel power flow algorithms through an interface to PYPOWER, although some features, such as ZIP loads
or unsymmetrical impedances will only work with the pandapower solvers.

<font size="4"><b>Unbalanced Power Flow</b></font>

An unbalanced power flow is currently being implemented and a first version will hopefully be released soon. Follow the progress
or join the implementation efforts on [github](https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower/issues/96), or subscribe to the [pandapower
mailing list](contact.md) for updates.

<h3 id="opf">Optimal Power Flow<br> </h3>
pandapower allows solving AC and DC optimal power flow (OPF) problems through interfacing
PYPOWER or [PowerModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl). Costs, flexibilities and constraints are configured through
the element-based pandapower data structure and internally converted to a PYPOWER or PowerModels data structure where the optimization
is carried out. Static loads can be used as flexibilities in the OPF, which allows optimization dispatch of static generators as well 
as load shedding. The cost function for each power injection or load can either be defined by a piecewise linear or a n-polynomial
cost function of the active and reactive power output of the respective elements.
<br><small>[Learn more](http://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/stable/powerflow/opf.html)</small>

<h3 id="se">State Estimation<br></h3>
pandapower includes a state estimation module that allows to estimate the electrical state of a network by dealing with inaccuracies
and errors from measurement data. pandapower supports measurement of voltages, active and reactive power or currents at bus, lines and
transformers. The state estimation is solved with a weighted-least-square method. It also includes a bad-data detection method based
on a Chi-squared and a normalized residuals test.
<br><small>[Learn more](http://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/stable/estimation.html)</small>

<h3 id="sc">Short-Circuit Calculation<br></h3>
pandapower includes a short-circuit calculation that allows to calculate fault currents for three-phase, two-phase and single phase 
short-circuits according to the IEC 60909 standard. The implementation also allows modeling power converter elements, such as 
PV plants or wind parks, according to the 2016 revision of the standard.
<br><small>[Learn more](http://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/stable/shortcircuit.html)</small>

<h3 id="topology">Graph Searches<br></h3>
pandapower provides the possibility of graph searches using the Python library [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) by providing a
possibility to translate pandapower networks into NetworkX graphs.
Once a network is translated into an abstract graph, all graph searches implemented in the NetworkX library can be used to analyze
the network structure. Additionally, pandapower also provides some predefined search algorithms to tackle common graph search problems
in electric networks, such as finding unsupplied buses or identifying buses on main or 
secondary network feeders.

<h2 id="tests">Tests and Validation</h2>

pandapower is tested with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). There are currently over 250 tests testing all kinds of pandapower functionality. The tests also include
automatic validation of pandapower results from power flow or short circuit calculations against commercial software, to ensure that the
implementation is correct.

<font size="5"><b>Continous Integration</b></font>

The tests are continuously carried out with Travis CI <a href="https://travis-ci.org/e2nIEE/pandapower"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/e2nIEE/pandapower.svg?branch=develop"></a>
in Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandapower"><img src="{{"/images/home/shield_python_versions.svg"|relative_url}}"></a>.
The test coverage rate is checked with codecov <a href="https://codecov.io/github/e2nIEE/pandapower?branch=master"><img src="https://codecov.io/github/e2nIEE/pandapower/coverage.svg?branch=develop"></a>
, code quality with codacy <a href="https://www.codacy.com/app/e2nIEE/pandapower/dashboard"><img src="https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/5d749ed6772e47f6b84fb9afb83903d3"></a>.

<font size="5"><b>Model Validation</b></font>

To ensure that pandapower loadflow results are correct, all pandapower element behaviour is tested against DIgSILENT PowerFactory or PSS Sincal. 

There is a result test for each of the pandapower elements that checks loadflow results in pandapower against results from a commercial tools. 

Here is an overview of all test networks that are used to validate the electric models:

{% include gallery caption="The pandapower test grids for validation of the electric models." %}

These minimal networks are used to compare power flow results with commercial tools. The tests ensure deviation
do not surpass the following tolerances:

| **Parameter**     | **Max. Deviation**  | 
|-------------------|---------------------| 
| Voltage Magnitude | 0.000001 pu         | 
| Voltage Angle     | 0.01°               | 
| Current           | 0.000001 kA         | 
| Power             | 0.005 kW            | 
| Element Loading   | 0.001%              | 

The validation process is explained in the following for the transformer as an example.

<font size="5"><b>Example: Transformer</b></font>

To validate the pandapower transformer model, a transformer is created with the same parameters in pandapower and PowerFactory.
To test all aspects of the model we use a transformer with:

 <ul>
 <small>
   <li>both iron and copper losses > 0</li>
   <li>nominal voltages that deviate from the nominal bus voltages at both sides</li>
   <li>an active tap changer</li>
   <li>a voltage angle shift > 0</li>
   <li>more than one parallel transformer</li>
  </small>
  </ul> 

We use a transformer with the following parameters:

 <ul>
 <small>
  <li>vk_percent= 5.0</li>
  <li>vkr_percent = 2.0</li>
  <li>i0_percent = 0.4</li>
  <li>pfe_kw = 2.0</li>
  <li>sn_mva = 0.4</li>
  <li>vn_hv_kv = 22</li>
  <li>vn_lv_kv = 0.42</li>
  <li>tap_max = 10</li>
  <li>tap_neutral = 5</li>
  <li>tap_min = 0</li>
  <li>tap_st_percent = 1.25</li>
  <li>tap_side = "hv"</li>
  <li>tap_pos = 3</li>
  <li>shift_degree = 150</li>
  </small>
  </ul> 

To validate the in_service parameter as well as the transformer switch element, we create three transformers in parallel: one in service, one out of service and one with an open switch in open loop operation.
All three transformers are connected to a 20kV / 0.4 kV bus network. The test network then looks like this:

<img src="{{"/images/about/validation/test_trafo.png" | relative_url }}" alt=""/>
   
The loadflow result for the exact same network are now compared in pandapower and PowerFactory. It can be seen that both bus voltages:

<img src="{{"/images/about/validation/validation_bus.png" | relative_url }}" alt=""/>
    
and transformer results:

<img src="{{"/images/about/validation/validation_trafo.png" | relative_url }}" alt=""/>

match within the margins defined above.
