pandapipes is an easy to use network calculation program aimed at automation of analysis of district heating
and gas systems. It utilizes the data analysis library pandas and is also closely related to
the power systems calculation program pandapower.

pandapipes and pandapower can be used in combination to analyze multi energy networks. An environment able to couple both
tools is pandapowerpro.

## Why another tool?

**Motivation**<br>

Multi-Energy networks and the utilization of synergies between energy sectors are an important research topic today. To
simulate these networks, it is crucial to not only include coupling points between the sectors in the analysis, but also to
know the network state of sectors of interest. pandapipes was developed to provide a tool capable of calculating
state variables of multi-energy networks. To do so, it can be used in combination with the open source software
pandapower. If only gas or district heating networks are of interest, pandapipes can also be used as a stand-alone 
application. 

In this sense, pandapipes closes two gaps: There are not many tools available which focus on multi-energy grid modeling.
In addition, most software for calculating fluid networks is only commercially available. The following table
summarizes some properties of commercial and open source tools, respectively.

This is of course a very broad classification of tools that is only supposed to illustrate the focus of pandapipes without
considering the diverse landscape of existing tools. 


**Scope**<br>

pandapipes is aimed at **static** analysis of **balanced** fluid systems. This allows analysis of:
- **Static** or **quasi-static** analyses of pressure and velocity distributions in fluid networks using incompressible or compressible media. Gas composition is assumed fix.
-  **Static** or **quasi-static** analyses of temperature distributions in fluid networks. At present, this kind of analysis is only possible for incompressible media.


<h2 id="modeling">Fluid System Modeling</h2>

<h3 id="datastructure">Tabular Data Structure</h3>

pandapipes is based on a tabular data structure, where every element type is represented by a table that holds all parameters for a specific
element and a result table which contains the element specific results of the different analysis methods. The tabular data structure is
based on the Python library pandas. It allows storing variables of any data type, so that parameters can be stored
together with status variables and meta-data, such as names or descriptions. The tables can be easily expanded and customized by adding new
columns without influencing the pandapipes functionality. All inherent pandas methods can be used to efficiently read, write and
analyze the network and results data.

<h3 id="std_types">Standard Type Libraries</h3>

pandapipes includes a standard type library that allows the creation of pipes and pumps using predefined basic standard type parameters. The user can either define individual standard types or use the predefined pandapipes basic standard types for convenient definition of networks.

<h3 id="std_types">Fluid Property Library</h3>

pandapipes includes a fluid property library that allows the creation of fluid properties using predefined data. The user can either define individual properties or use the predefined data.
   
<h2 id="analysis">Fluid System Analysis</h2>

pandapipes supports the following fluid systems analysis functions:

- [Pipe Flow](#pf)


<h3 id="pf">Pipe Flow</h3>

The pandapipes pipe flow solver is based on the Newton-Raphson method.
<br><small>[Learn more](https://pandapipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pipeflow.html)</small>
<br>
To initialize the solution vector for the pipe flow calculation pandapipes offers two different methods:
 <ul>
 <small>
  <li>flat start</li>
  <li>solution vector of a previous calculation</li>
  </small>
 </ul>

<h2 id="tests">Tests and Validation</h2>

So far pandapipes has been successfully tested with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
To ensure the correctness of the functionalities in pandapipes, various test networks were created,
in which different factors were varied:

 <ul>
 <small>
  <li>medium: gas and water</li>
  <li>topology</li>
  <li>pressure at external grids</li>
  <li>number of external grids</li>
  <li>friction model</li>
  <li>length, diameter and roughness of a pipe</li>
  <li>volume flow</li>
  <li>number and height values of nodes</li>
  <li>direction of pipe link between nodes, for checking the correct flow velocity calculation</li>
  <li>combinations of sources, sinks, pumps, valves and external grids</li>
  <li>heat network calculation (only with OpenModelica)</li>
  </small>
 </ul>

<br>
The test networks were created in [STANET](http://www.stafu.de/de/home.html) and
[OpenModelica](https://www.openmodelica.org/) and transformed into a
pandapipes network using the respective converter to perform the tests
in [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). A total of 83 tests were created
using both programs. 22 water and 21 gas networks with STANET and 32 water and 8 heating
networks with OpenModelica. How to call up the individual example networks is described in
the [Networks](https://pandapipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/networks.html) chapter of the documentation.
The structures of all test networks are listed below:

<h3 id="tests_stanet">STANET Tests</h3>

The STANET test nets were saved in CSV format so that a conversion
into a json file can take place. A test is considered passed, if certain error tolerances are met.
The relative error <math><mi>p<sub>diff</sub></mi></math> during the calculation of the pressures
mostly has a value less than 0.002. In two cases the limit has to be increased, once to 0.01
and the second time to 0.03.

Furthermore, the absolute error in the calculation of the flow velocities <math><mi>v<sub>diff,abs</sub></mi></math>
is always less than 0.03.

<h3 id="tests_om">OpenModelica Tests</h3>

Using the mo- and a mat-file containing the simulation results, the OpenModelica
net will be converted into a pandapipes network.
OpenModelica uses the [Navier-Stokes equations](https://www.maplesoft.com/documentation_center/online_manuals/modelica/Modelica_Fluid_UsersGuide_ComponentDefinition.html#Modelica.Fluid.UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.BalanceEquations)
to calculate pressure loss and flow velocities. Whereas pandapipes uses an approach similar to STANET.
Consequently, the tolerances for errors for passing a test should be increased.
For the relative error <math><mi>p<sub>diff</sub></mi></math> with respect to pressure, a limit of 0.01
is usually sufficient. In 3 cases the limit should be increased to 0.02 and
in 2 cases to 0.06 and 0.4 respectively.
Presumably, the deviations are caused by the complexity of the networks, in which pumps and
valves are usually found. However, it is not generally due to the use of pumps and valves,
since test networks with pumps and valves that maintain a fault tolerance of 0.01 also exist.
In addition, the limit for the relative pressure deviation for heating networks lies in a
range between 0.01 and 0.05.

In the following, the deviations of pressures and flow velocities from the OpenModelica and pandapipes
calculations are graphically displayed for three different networks. The first net is the
[Delta net](https://pandapipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/networks/meshed/meshed_networks.html#delta)
calculated with Prandtl-Colebrook where <math><mi>p<sub>diff</sub></mi></math> is less than 0.01:

For the [Pumps net](https://pandapipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/networks/meshed/meshed_networks.html#pumps)
using Swamee-Jain for calculation, <math><mi>p<sub>diff</sub></mi></math> is below 0.02 and
has the below deviations in the junctions and the pipes:

At last the deviations for a network with valves are shown. Here, a limit of 0.4 must be set for the
relative error with respect to pressure to pass the test. The [Valves network](https://pandapipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/networks/t_cross/t_cross_networks.html#valves)
was calculated with Prandtl-Colebrook:

In order to create your own nets in OpenModelica and to perform a comparison with pandapipes,
the elements that serve as equivalents for the components in pandapipes are listed hereafter:

In the case of heat network calculation, the DynamicPipe must be used instead of the StaticPipe:

The medium is water with a temperature of 293.15 K, where the ambient temperature has the same value.
The fluid properties can be called using special methods in OpenModelica,
for this purpose the source code must be considered.
